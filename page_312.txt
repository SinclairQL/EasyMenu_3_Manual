5.6 EASYMENCasm assembler library routines overview

The easymenCasm_/ib library contains special variants of the EM_, EU_ and

EW_ routines. These take the parameters directly from the registers. Routines

not present here can be used either by pushing the parameters or use of the

window manager routines directly (e.g. wm.swapp, )

There are two labels for each routine, one where the underscore is replaced by a

full stop and one by an X (for assemblers which do not allow a. in a label name).
{ The easymenCastib library has external references into the easymenC_/ib
_1‘library.ﬁTherefore both libraries must be present in the linker control file:

LIBRARY fle_easymenCasm_lib
LIBRARY fle_easyrnenC_lib

in this order!

Both'the easymenCJib library routines and the easymenCasm_/ib library
routines use exatly the same extended working definition. Therefore both type of
roiitine‘s‘can be used within the same program!

The result area is accessed using the offset definition of the extended working
definition (normally as offsets from a4) ->keys__addwdef.

The buffer area is only intended for temporary data and may be used by the
application program as well. The result area is used to pass values back.

The desription of the functions is the same as for the easymenC_/ib library.

This is the structure of a window manager menu definition.
As this definition contains short (word) pointers, it is not
suitable to be defined from within a C-module.

EASYMENU generates window definitions in relocatable form, so
normally only the pointer to the definition must be defined
as an external label within the C-module which manages the menu.

Anyway the description is given here in the form of
structure definitions.

Assembler programmers may substitute

long by dc.l
short by dc.w
char by dc.b

to get the equivalent definitions in assembler.

The definitions are mainly intended for informational or debugging

purposes.

Advanced programmers may adapt and use the definitions if a very complex
program requires this.

Please notice that, if you want to replace the default

setup, draw, control or hit routines by C written routines,

you must initialize in_rout structures which simply consist

of an assembler instruction to jump to a suitable library
routine which in turn prepares parameters, calls the C—written
routine and retrieves parameters afterwards.

Dimensional parameters must be altered accordingly

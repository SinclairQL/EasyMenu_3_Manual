/* The menu row list is an array of pointers to the start and end of the menu
object list for each row

A menu row list entry is defined by:

*/
struct wwm_mrow {

long *wwm_rows; /* pointer to row start */
long *wwm_rowe; /* pointer to row end */
l;

/* A menu row list for N rows set up by the program may be initialized

* as follows:

* struct wwm_mrow aw1_mrow[NUMROW] ={

* {wwm_aw1 r1 ,wwm_aw1r1+NUMCOL}

* {... },

* {wwm_aw‘l rN,wwm_aw‘l rN+NUMCOL}

* };

* To access an existing definition, define pointers to the structures

* and fill them in with the pointers found in the existing application

sub-window definition.

/* For each pannable and/or scrollable sub-window, wwp_part and/or wws_part
* point to a sub-window section control block:

* ————————————————————————————

* For each section there is a sub-window section control block record
*/

struct wss_scbr {

short wss_spos; /* section start pixel position */

shOrt wss_sstt; /* section start column or row */

short wss_ssiz; /* section size (number of columns

/* The whole block for one dimension consists of a short integer which

* Please notice that there must be enough space forthe maximum number of

sections (wwa_nxsc or wwa_nysc in the application sub-window definition).*/

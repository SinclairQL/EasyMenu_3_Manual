EASYPTR 3 Library Routines Part III 247

III. 4 The EASYMENu Control Library Routines

There are two libraries:

easymenC_lib
is intended for the C programmer as the routines in this library take the
parameters from the stack. And

easymenCasm_lib
which is intended to be used from assembler, as these routines take the
parameters from the registers.
Both, the assembler- and the C- -programmer may take great advantage of the
very easy way to create a menu controlled program.
The easymenC_ lib routines follow the left to right parameter passing convention
(see below) and thus can be used with the Metacomco Lattice C and the C68
compilers as well (and naturally with any other C-compiler using the same
convenï¬‚on)
If these routines are called from assembler (which is also possible), the
assembler programmer has to ensure himself that the parameters are passed on
the stack in the right order.

The description of the functions is valid both for C and assembler.

Attention:
The routines have different prefixes. The meanings are

Prefix EM
All EM, routines are standard routines to setup and control a menu definition.
These routines must only be used on a menu setup with EM_SETUP

Prefix EU
All EU_ routines are utility routines which are not directly coupled with a menu
definition.

Prefix EW

All EW_ routines can be used on any standard menu working definition, i.e. on a
definition set up with EM~SETUP or on a definition set up using the standard
window manager routines as well.

Prefix El

The library also contains these routines, which prepare parameters for
internal routines written in C. The descriptions can be found in chapter 3.

282 Part lll EASYPTIF’R3 Library Routines

EW__AWSCT

Description

This routine can be used to setup the application sub-window section control
blocks. This routine should be called after the menu definition has been set up
(e.g. with WM_SMENU). But it must be called with applwdef pointing to the same
location (wwa_mstt) in the working definition as passed to EC_AWSET.
Therefore this pointer must be copied to applwdef before calling WM_SMENU,

e.g:

 

long applwdef=subworkdef;
err =wm_smenu (xscale,yscale,status,wman,&subwindef,&subworkdef);

err =ew_awsct (startcol,startrow,panctrl,scrollctrl,applwdef,&subworkdef);

Parameter declarations

long err,panctrl,scrollctrl,applwdef,subworkdef;
short startcol,startrow;
Function call

err =ew_awsct (startcol,startrow,panctrl,scrollctrl,applwdef,&subworkdef);

Function return

err 0

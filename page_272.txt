EM_WDRAW 5,457/sz

Description

Draw (redraw) a complete menu window structure

The initial position parameters are only relevant on the first call after EM__SETUP,
is. they can be omitted for redraw.

lithe position parameters are both given as -1, then the menu is drawn at the
actual pointer position, i.e. the initial pointer position defined in the menu
definition is positionned such that the systems pointer position must not be
changed. if the menu window would fall outside the window limits (-> iOP_FLlM)
the position is adjusted accordingly.

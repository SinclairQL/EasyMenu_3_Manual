250 Part III EASYPTR3 Library Routines

 

4.4 EASYMENCasm Library routines (assembler only)

To make life a little bit easier for assembler programmers a special

easymenCasm_lib

library is available, which contains special variants of the EM_, EU_ and EW_
routines.

These take the parameters directly from the registers.

Routines not present here can be used either by pushing the parameters or use
of the window manager routines directly (e.g. wm.swapp, )

There are two labels for each routine, one where the underscore is replaced by a
full stop and one by an X. This is to allow usage of the routines with assemblers
which do not allow a full stop in a label name.

The easymenCasm_lib library has external references into the easymenC_Iib
library.

Therefore both libraries must be present in the linker control file:

LIBRARY fle_easymenCasm_lib
LIBRARY fle_easymenC_lib

in this order!

Both the easymenC_lib library routines and the easymenCasm_lib library
routines use exatly the same extended working definition.

Therefore it is possible to use both types of routines within the same program!
The result area is accessed using the offset definition of the extended working
definition (normally as offsets from a4) -> keys_addwdef

The buffer area is only intended for temporary data and may be used by the
application program as well.

The result area is used to pass values back.

But the three longwords from w_flag and the linked list pointer w_link
must never be changed!

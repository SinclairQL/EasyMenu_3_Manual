EASYPTR3 Library Routines Part III 249

 

4.1 Internal routines (C only)

Principally the handling of internal routines by the EASYMENC Library Routines
is the same as described in chapter 3.1.

Additionally if a pointer to an internal routine in the EASYMENU generated menu
definition is zero, then EM_SETUP will replace it by it's own routine. if the pointer
is not zero, then EM_SETUP assumes that you have an own routine there and
sets this routine.

More detailed information about the handling of action routines is given in 4.5.

4.2 Register A5 and A6

Registers A5 and A6 are in no way affected by the EASYMENU Library Routines.
Thus e.g. they can be used to point to private data areas accessible from within
the internal setup or action routines.

For C this principally means, that local parameters of the calling routine would be
accessible from within internal routines.

4.3 Address Pointers (C only)
For QDOS we generally assume address pointers to be long integers!

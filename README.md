# EasyMenu 3 Manual
This repository is the basis for a reproduction of the EasyMenu 3 manual, for which, the original files have been lost.

The repository holds a number of text files, being the scanned and OCR'd pages of plain text only, for the C library section of the manual. Pages 247 to 314 inclusive.

The JPEGS folder/directory contains a 17.2 MB zipped copy of the original JPEGs that were OCR'd. These were created in high quality, 300 dpi format. There is one file per page.

Dilwyn has scanned and OCR'd pages 159 to 246 of the manual into a pair of Word `*.docx` format files.

_All_ of the files will need tidying up. OCR is far from perfect, but is a tad better than typing everything back in.


All attempts to help reproduce the manual gratefully received.

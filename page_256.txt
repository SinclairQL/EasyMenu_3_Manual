256 Part III EASYPTR 3 Library Routines

EM_AMSET

Description
Setup application sub-window menu.
This only works if there is no menu structure in the sub-window (->EM_AMCLR).

Use EWAWINF to find the address of the sub-window.
This routine should not be called from within the application sub-window setup
routine or any other internal routine.
The routine sets default internal routine pointers, as described for EM_SETUP.
The spacing lists for each dimension consist of two short integer values for each
column (row) giving the hit size and the spacing to the next element.
Please notice, that the spacing must at least be as large as the hit size + the
current item border width (which must be doubled in x direction as usual).

Regular spacings can be given in one entry in negative values, e.g.

short xspc[2]={—40,—42};

Please notice, that the bar and arrow colours are taken as defined with the \
window in EASYMENU, but they can be altered using the application sub—window
structure definition.
If the pointer to the menu object list is zero, then only the pan/scroll bars are set
up. Use EM_MDRAW to draw the menu.

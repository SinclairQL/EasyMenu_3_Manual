Description

Set up a working definition from an EASYMENU generated menu definition.

- use a given window channel or open a new one.

- calculate memory size of working definition and reserve memory

- setup menu structure from window definition

- if action-, draw-, hit- and control-routine pointers are zero, set default routines
- return size of actual layout and channel lD

- return address of status area, result area and working definition

The working definition is extended below it's start for additional data. The
complete format of this area is described in chapter 5.

Please notice that the structure of the working definition itself is absolutely
standard, i.e. all standard window manager operations can be performed, but
then the result area is not filled in.

All EM_ routines will report the error 'err.fdnf' if they are called with a working
definition not set up with EM_SETUP!

5.3 Window status area

/* The window status area is used to control an existing menu as defined

* with the window working definition.

The status area is normally set up by wm.setup.

The control data is filled in or altered by wm.rptr and the action

routines in case.

The loose menu item status block, which is a byte for each loose menu
item, follows immediately after the window working area.

Other status or control areas, e.g. for application sub-window menus, may
also follow, but those pointers are held in the application sub-window
definition.*/

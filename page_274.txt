274 Part III EASYPTR 3 Library Routines

EU_PWMAK

Description

Try to make a known primary channel.

This only works if there is no or only 'still unused channels open, e.g. at the
beginning of a C program after the startup module has only opened some
standard channels.

Do not call EU_PWTST before EU_PWMAK, because then an existing channel
might have been marked to be the primary.

The procedure will break if there is already an existing primary channel marked.
In this case a new opened channel is closed again, and the error 'err.fdiu' is
returned.

 

if the primary channel shall be accessible using standard C IO routines (e.g.
fprinti, ...), then a channel should be opened using fopeno, and the channel ID
found with fgetchidO should be passed to EU_PWMAK.
